/*
Let's create a Simple Vending Program. 
At the end of this exercise, you will have a program that can select items, enter amount of money, display item of choice and the amount of change back. 
Your program will also be able to tell the user their money is not enough, and whether they want to buy another item again. 

This project covers the everything you have learned so far including:
Variables
Assignments
Conditional Statements
Loops

Let's get started! 

 First, declare the following variables into the program:
int numofChoice;
float amtMoney, amtChange;

 Then, create a screen for the user to decide what to buy:
cout << "Select an Item:  << endl;
cout << "(1) Chocolate Bar - $ 10.00" << endl;
cout << "(2) Potato Chips - $ 17.00 " << endl;
cout << "(3) Gummy Bears  - $ 6.50  " << endl;
cout << "(4) Cup Noodles  - $ 21.30 " << endl;
cout << "(5) Peanuts      - $ 13.00 " << endl;

Afterwards, create one more output statement as well as an input to take the user's input of choice.
 
cout << "Enter Number of Choice: ";
cin >> numofChoice;

When you run your program, you should have something like this:
