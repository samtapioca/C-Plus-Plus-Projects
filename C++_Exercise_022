Consider the following:

A juice jug can hold 3.75 litre of juice. Your uncle ships jugs of juice to a local store every weekend. The cost of producing one litre of juice is $3.4 and the profit of each jug of juice is 2.45.

Write a program that:

Accepts the user to enter the total amount of juice produced on the weekend.
Prints out the number of juice jugs needed to hold the juice.
Prints out the cost of producing milk
Prints out the profit for producing milk
