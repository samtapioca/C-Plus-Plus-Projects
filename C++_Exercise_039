/*
Instructions: 

Write a program that does the following functions:

prints out Good Morning + user's name when user types the word "Morning"
prints out Good Night + user's name when user types the word "Night"
prints out Good Night + user's name when user types the word "Birthday"

When the user types "Goodbye", it will print out Good bye + user's name and end the program.

Hint: use the while loop to have the program loop back to the question.
