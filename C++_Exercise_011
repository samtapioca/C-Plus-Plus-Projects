/*
Instructions: 

Let's have x = 12 and y = 6.
Write the following values into the program and have it print out the values of the following expressions:

x / 4
x + y * 2
(x * y) - 2
x % y
x / 4.0
(x * 3) * y

Example: 

int x = 4, y = 5, result; 

result = x + y;
cout << "4 + 5 = " << result << endl; 

result = x * y;
cout << "4 * 5 = " << result << endl;

#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 

int main() {
  
  int x, y, result;
  
  //Expression #1
  result = ;
  cout << " " << result << endl;
  
   //Expression #2
  result = ;
  cout << " " << result << endl;
  
   //Expression #3
  result = ;
  cout << " " << result << endl;
  
   //Expression #4
  result = ;
  cout << " " << result << endl;
  
   //Expression #5
  result = ;
  cout << " " << result << endl;
  
   //Expression #6
  result = ;
  cout << " " << result << endl;
