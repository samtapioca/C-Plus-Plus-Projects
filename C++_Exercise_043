/*
Instructions:

Write a program that allows you to enter up to to 10 students and get the student's information (first name, last name, age, favourite subject) and print out the results.

IF the users enters a number greater than 10, the program will display an error message and end the program.

Else, it will call two functions: 
enterStudents (Function that lets you input student details) 
displayStudents(Function that displays the information of n of students)


Here is a sample output:

using namespace std;
