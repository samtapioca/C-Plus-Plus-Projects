/*
Instructions: 

Write a simple ticket booking program that let's the user buy tickets for a specific artist.
There are only 5 tickets available for each purchase. 

If the user inputs a number greater 5 and less than 1, the program should tell the user to input again.

The user will be asked how many tickets they want and what type of ticket (General Admission, Silver Admission, and Gold Admission). 

If the user inputs a number greater 5 and less than 1, the program should tell the user to input again.

Afterwards, the program will display the following:
Name of the concert
Number of Tickets
Tickets
A message saying "Thank you for your buying!"

The program will then end.


Here is a sample for the following program:
