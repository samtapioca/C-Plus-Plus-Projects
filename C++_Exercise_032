/*
By now your project should be something like this:
https://Vending-Machine-Part-1.micromodules.repl.run

Make sure you've completed Part 1 before moving on to this part.

Now that our program can display the items of the vending machine, let's have it return the item we are choosing.

For this we'll use conditional statements. 

You can choose to use switch statements or if statements, but I will show you the if statements process. 

Add if statements to have the program display the item we are choosing.
if (numofChoice == 1 )   
{
      cout << "You chose Chocolate Bar "; 
}
else if (numofChoice == 2 )   
{
      cout << "You chose Potato Chips ";
}
.
.
.
.

Try to complete the rest of the choices into your program.


Here's the complete code and output of our vending machine so far:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    int numofChoice;
    float amtMoney, amtChange;
    string productChoice;
    
    cout << endl;
    cout << "----Select an Item-----" << endl;
    cout << "o=============================o" << endl;
    cout << "| (1) Chocolate Bar - $ 10.00 |" << endl;
    cout << "| (2) Potato Chips  - $ 17.00 |" << endl;
    cout << "| (3) Gummy Bears   - $ 6.50  |" << endl;
    cout << "| (4) Cup Noodles   - $ 21.30 |" << endl;
    cout << "| (5) Peanuts       - $ 13.00 |" << endl;
    cout << "o=============================o" << endl << endl;
    
    cout << "Enter Number of Choice: ";
    cin >> numofChoice;
    
    //insert if statements here
    
}
