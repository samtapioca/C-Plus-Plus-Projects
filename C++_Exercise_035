By now your project should be something like this:
https://repl.it/@micromodules/Vending-Machine-Part-4

So far in our project, our vending machine contains the following features:

Have the user input to select an Item
Display the item they chose and price of the item
Have the to user to input amount of money
Compute the amount of change to display back to the user
Display a message stating that the user didn't not input enough money 

Nice job! You've done five features so far in this project.
We're almost done with our simple vending machine program.

What we're going to do next is:
If the user enters enters an amount less than the item's price, display a message stating that the user didn't input enough money and exit the program.
After the user purchases one item, have the user to choose to buy another item or exit the program.

Let's work on the second feature first.

Consider this sample output:
Enter Number of Choice: 1
You chose Chocolate Bar
Price: $10.00 
Enter amount of money: 20

You chose Chocolate Bar
Amount of Money Entered: $20
Your change is $10

Now let's give the user the option to either buy another item or exit the program.

Let's add a statement to ask the user whether they want to buy again or not.
.
.
.
if (amtMoney >= 10)
{
   amtChange = amtMoney - 10.00;
   cout << endl;
   cout << "You chose Chocolate Bar"     << endl;
   cout << "Money Entered: " << amtMoney << endl;
   cout << "Change: " << amtChange       << endl;
   cout << "Would you like to buy again? (Y/N);
   cin  >> buyAgain;
}
To avoid any confusion, you can align your endl statements to each other to keep your code readable and organised.
Do this for the following nested if statements.

Notice I'm having the user to type yes or no (Y/N) whether they want to buy again.
I also used an input statement to take the user's input using the buyAgain variable.

Let's declare this variable in Line 8.
char buyAgain = 'Y';

Let's understand the concept:

If the user wants to buy another time, we need to ask to select an item again. We can do that by adding another if statement, but if they keep buying and buying, we will use a lot of if statements. But we're not going to do that. Instead, we are going to use the while loop.

Place this loop inside the main function:
while (buyAgain == 'Y' || buyAgain == 'y')
 {
 .
 .
 }
  return 0;
}
Note: Using this condition will allow the user to input uppercase 'Y' OR lowercase 'y'.

WHILE the user inputs Y, it will loop back to the beginning of the program and ask the user to select an item again.

By now your project should look like this:

https://Vending-Machine-Part-5-1.micromodules.repl.run


When you run the program and enter enough money to buy the item and input yes to buying again, it will go back to the item menu.

But, when you don't enter enough money. You will notice that the program will still loop back and have the user select an item. 

Previously, we were discussing on what the program will do if the user doesn't enter enough money to buy their item.
if 
{
.
.
.
}
else
{
   cout << "Not enough money." << endl;
}


We need to have the program exit when the user hasn't input enough money. To do that, we will use the break statement.

if
{ 
  . 
  . 
  . 
} 
else 
{    
   cout << "Not enough money." << endl;    
}



If the user didn't put enough money, we need to have the user exit the program and not be able to buy their item. So that the next person who uses the program can buy an item.

Let's add an output to do display the following options for the user:
.
.
.
else 
{    
    cout << "Not enough money." << endl; 
    break;
}
This will end the program after the output statement has been executed.

and lastly, let's add one more output statement above return 0; to ensure the user that the program has ended:

 
.
.
.
 }
  cout << "Exiting Program..." << endl;
  cout << "Goodbye! " << endl;
  return 0;
}


And that's it!

You have just completed your simple vending machine system!

Your final simple vending machine contains the following features:

Have the user input to select an Item
Display the item they chose and price of the item
Have the to user to input amount of money
Compute the amount of change to display back to the user
Display a message stating that the user didn't not input enough money 
If the user enters enters an amount less than the item's price, display a message stating that the user didn't input enough money and exit the program.
After the user purchases one item, have the user to choose to buy another item or exit the program.

Here's the complete code and output of our simple vending machine:
