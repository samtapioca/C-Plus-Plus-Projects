Instructions:

Write a simple ticketing program that does the following:
Prints out the name of concert, location and number of tickets available. (Assume that there are only 5 tickets available).
Ask the user to enter number of tickets they want to purchase.  If the user enters a number greater than 5, display a message stating their input is invalid. 
Ask the user the type of ticket they want to buy. The user can choose to buy General Admission ($480), Silver Admission ($895) , and Gold Admission ($1355). 
After they bought a ticket, print out the summary of purchase (Name of Concert, Number of Tickets bought, Ticket Type, Total Price of Tickets.)

You can write any concert name and location of your choice.

Here is a sample output:
