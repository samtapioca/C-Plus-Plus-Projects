/*
To be able to declare using std::string, we'll need to add another library to our program, called string.

#include <string>

Afterwards, write a program that asks the user for his favourite soft drink and ice cream.

std::getLine(std::cin, faveSoftDrink);
The program will print out the results.

Sample Output
What is your favourite soft drink? Sprite

What is your favourite ice cream? Chocolate Ice Cream

Your favourite soft drink is Sprite
Your favourite ice cream is Chocolate Ice Cream
