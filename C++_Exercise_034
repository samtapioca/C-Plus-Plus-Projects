By now your project should be something like this:
https://repl.it/@micromodules/Vending-Machine-Part-3

So far in our vending machine, we are now able to:
Ask the user to select an Item
Display the item they chose and price of the item
Ask to user to input amount of money

What we're going to do next is:
Compute the amount of change to display back to the user
Display an message stating that the user didn't not input enough money 

The amount of change(We will use amtMoney of float type from Line 7) will be computed if the user enters a number greater or equal to its original price. 

if (numofChoice == 1)
{
.
.
.
//insert if statement here
  if (amtMoney >= 10) 
  {


  }
}


The first item will be greater or equal to 10 because the first item cost $10.
Do this for the following items.

Inside our nested if statement, we'll place an assignment that will be used to compute the change, using amtChange variable we've used in Line 7.

Let's add this inside our first nested if statement:
if (amtMoney >= 10) 
{
   amtChange = amtMoney - 10.00;

}
Do this for the following items.

Display the following messages as well:
{
amtChange = amtMoney - 10.00;
cout << "Amount of Money Entered: " << endl;
cout << "Your change is " << amtChange << endl;
}
Do this for the following items.

Now that we've finished our nested if statements, let's move on to the else statement.

Place an else statement under the if statement that displays if the user did not input enough money:
if 
{
.
.
.
}
else
{
   cout << "Not enough money." << endl;
}

In the next exercise, we add the following features:

If the user enters enters an amount less than the item's price, display a message stating that the user didn't input enough money and exit the program.
After the user purchases one item, have the user to choose to buy another item or exit the program.


Here's the complete code and output of our vending machine so far:
