By now your project should be something like this:
https://repl.it/@micromodules/Vending-Machine-Part-2


Let's have the choices display their amount as well:

if (numofChoice == 1 )   
{
      cout << "You chose Chocolate Bar "; 
      cout << "Price: $10.00: << endl;
}
.
.
.

If the user inputs a number not equal to numbers 1-5, we should also tell the user to input the correct number. They should not be able to buy a product if they input an invalid number.

else 
{
    cout << "Invalid Number. Enter a number from 1-5." << endl; 
}

Next step is to allow the user to enter their amount of cash. 
We add another output statement to tell the user to enter their amount of money, and an input statement to store the value.

We will use our variable amtMoney for this input statement.

if (numofChoice == 1)
{
cout << endl;
cout << "You chose Chocolate Bar" << endl;
cout << "Price: $10.00 " << endl;
cout << "Enter amount of money: ";
cin >> amtMoney;

}

 Do this for the following items as well.

(Note: I added another endl to print a new line first before printing out the next line.)


Here's the complete code and output of our vending machine so far:
